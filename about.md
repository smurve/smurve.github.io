One of the most amazing experiences these days is the ubiquitous availability of knowledge. If you know how to travel 
the internet, you'll find an abundance of tutorials, explanations, video how-tos, and what not. I'm a desperately 
curious guy. And I want to understand just about everything. Once, I needed to build light barriers for speed detections that would radio their
measured speed to a computer. Didn't know anything about electronics at that time (maybe I'll blog about that later).
So I googled my way from Arduino and XBee to photo resistors and soldering, found everything I needed to know, and now 
I have a dozen of these light barriers. Have a look at the [FastAndFurious Project](https://github.com/FastAndFurious/fnf.documentation),
if you're curious what I have them for...


More recently, I got obsessed with neural networks. The tech news are full of
ever more amazing new capabilities of these things, and I really desperately wanted to understand. So, again, I went on another
Google-driven tour and found extensive blogs that made this amazing subject accessible to me. Most noteworthy amongst 
those sources are my all-time favourites [Michael Nielson's beautiful online book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) 
 and [Chris Olah's Blog](http://colah.github.io/). 
 
 
 Well, and now I can't help but add my humble, infinitesimal contribution to this seemingly endless world of knowledge called the 
 [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) and hang around between the toes of the aforementioned giants...
